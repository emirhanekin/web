Sportist Privacy Policy

Bermuda, LLC (“Sportist”) respects the privacy rights of our users and are committed to protecting the information collected through our online products, online services and websites including but not limited to the Sportist application (any or all of which are referred to as “Apps”). Sportist has adopted this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain how Sportist collects, stores, and uses the information collected in connection with Sportist’s Apps.

BY INSTALLING, USING, REGISTERING TO OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING ANY APPS, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND GIVE AN EXPLICIT AND INFORMED CONSENT TO THE STORAGE, USE, AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL, USE, REGISTER TO OR OTHERWISE ACCESS ANY APPS. Sportist reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If Sportist makes material or significant changes to this Privacy Policy, the updates will be posted to the website at https://www.esport.ist/privacy. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon their being posted on Sportist’s website. Your continued use of Apps will signify your acceptance of the changes to this Privacy Policy.

Non-personal Data
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “non-personal data” means information that does not directly identify you, which may include your age, weight, and gender. Additionally, non-personal data includes “aggregate” and “de-personalized” information, which is data Sportist collects about the use of Sportist Apps, from which any personally identifiable data has been removed.

Sportist collects non-personal data from you to make your use of the Apps more efficient and useful. For example, if you provide non-personal data about you, the App may provide certain information about your workout such as calories burned or other tailored calculations about your workout.

Sportist also uses tools and third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not directly enable Sportist to identify you. The types of non-personal data Sportist may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) device properties, including, but not limited to unique device identifier or other device identifier (“UDID”); (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as zip code, area code and location; (v) game score and achievements; (vi) other non-personal data as reasonably required by Sportist to enhance the Apps and other Sportist products and services.

Sportist shares non-personal data, including both data you provide to Sportist and data which is automatically collected, with Sportist’s partners and contractors for purposes of analyzing usage of the Apps, advertisement serving, managing and providing the Apps, and to further develop the Apps and other Sportist services and products.

You recognize and agree that the analytics companies utilized by Sportist may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to your activities. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.

Ad Serving Technology
Sportist reserves the right to use and disclose collected non-personal data for purposes of advertisement by Sportist or Sportist’s partners and contractors. Sportist employs third party ad serving technologies that use certain methods to collect information as a result of ad serving through Apps. Sportist or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use your demographic and location information, non-personal data you provide to Sportist, and information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Service. Sportist or third parties may collect and use data for this purpose including, but not limited to IP address (including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), UDID, software, applications, hardware, browser information, internet and on-line usage information and in-game information. The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.

You recognize and agree that the advertising companies who deliver ads for Sportist may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. These ad serving technologies are integrated into Apps; if you do not want to be subject to this technology, do not use or access Apps. Although Sportist takes commercially reasonable steps to instruct such advertising companies to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, Sportist does not have access to or control of third party technologies.

Personal Data
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal data” means personally identifiable information that specifically identifies you as an individual.

Likely situations when you make personal data available to Sportist include, but are not limited to: (i) registration for Apps, contests and special events; (ii) accessing Apps using a third party ID, such as social networking sites or gaming services; (iii) subscribing to newsletters; (iv) purchasing a product or services through Sportist’s online stores; (v) using “tell a friend,” “email this page,” or other similar features; (vi) requesting technical support; and (vii) otherwise through use of Sportist’s Apps where personal data is required for use and/or participation.

The types of personal data may vary depending on the type of activity you are engaged in. The personal data Sportist may collect, process and use may include, but are not limited to your name, screen/nick name, Sportist Apps’ or third party service ID, e-mail address, phone number, photo or other image, birthdate, sex, address, friend connections, avatar image, credit card information, shipping information; and location (only if directly identifiable to you, otherwise Sportist treats location as non-personal data).

Sportist may use collected personal data for purposes of analyzing usage of the Apps, providing customer and technical support, managing and providing Apps (including managing advertisement serving) and to further develop the Apps and other Sportist services and products. Sportist may combine non-personal data with personal data.

Sportist may use your personal data to send messages to you with informative and/or commercial content about Sportist’s services or third party products and services Sportist thinks may be of interest to you, such as new features and services, special offers and updated information.

Please note that certain features of the Apps may be able to connect to your social networking sites to obtain additional information about you.  In such cases, Sportist may be able to collect certain information from your social networking profile when your social networking site permits it, and when you consent to allow your social networking site to make that information available to Sportist.  This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, profile picture, gender, user ID, email address, your country, your language, your time zone, the organizations and links on your profile page, the names and profile pictures of your social networking site “friends” and other information you have included in your social networking site profile. Sportist may associate and/or combine as well as use information collected by Sportist and/or obtained through such social networking sites in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Disclosure and Transfer of Personal Data
Sportist collects and processes personal data on a voluntary basis and it is not in the business of selling your personal data to third parties. Personal data may, however, occasionally be disclosed in accordance with law and this Privacy Policy. Additionally, Sportist may disclose personal data to any of its affiliated companies in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Sportist may hire agents and contractors to collect and process personal data on Sportist’s behalf and in such cases such agents and contractors will be instructed to comply with our Privacy Policy and to use personal data only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by Sportist. These agents and contractors may not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes. Sportist may use third party service providers such as credit card processors, e-mail service providers, shipping agents, data analyzers and business intelligence providers. Sportist has the right to share your personal data as necessary for the aforementioned third parties to provide their services for Sportist. Sportist is not liable for the acts and omissions of these third parties, except as provided by applicable law.

Sportist may disclose your personal data to third parties as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or Sportist to legal liability. Sportist may also disclose your personal data to third parties when Sportist has a reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with Sportist’s rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or Sportist believes that such disclosure is necessary to protect Sportist’s rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Sportist. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Sportist will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such disclosure through Sportist’s website or in another reasonable manner.

Data Retention
Sportist retains the data collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Thereafter if the collected data is no longer needed for purposes specified in this Privacy Policy, Sportist deletes all aforementioned data in our possession within a reasonable timeframe. Sportist does not verify the correctness of personal data.

Sportist may still retain some of the data to the extent such retention is necessary to resolve disputes, enforce Sportist user agreements, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of Apps.

If you reside or are located in a European Union member country or Switzerland, any personal data about you will be collected, used and retained in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If you are a resident of a country subject to the GDPR and wish to exercise any of your rights regarding your data which has been collected or is being stored by Sportist, including access of your data, correcting inaccurate data, or deleting your data, please contact Sportist at the email address set forth at the bottom of this policy.

Correction and Deletion of Data
Sportist will provide you with reasonable access to any of your personal data which you have provided to us. If you wish to access, update or correct any personal data we hold about you, or if you want us to delete any information about you that we have collected, you may contact us as set forth at the bottom of this privacy policy. At your request, we will update, correct, or delete from our databases any personally-identifiable information we have about you.

Cookies, Beacons and Tracking
The Apps may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags, clear GIFs and web beacons. Sportist treats information collected by cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.

E-mails and other electronic communications Sportist sends to you may contain code that enables Sportist to track your usage of the communication, including whether the communication was opened and/or what links were followed (if any). Sportist may combine that information to other information Sportist has about you and Sportist may use that information to improve the Apps and/or provide customized communications to you.

Third Party Terms and Conditions
Please note that your access to and use of the Apps may be subject to certain third party terms and conditions and privacy policies, including but not limited to application stores, mobile software platforms, on-line gaming platforms, social networking services and payment providers. You recognize and agree that Sportist is not liable for any such third party terms and conditions and their use of your personal data.

Sportist may in its discretion make available links through advertisements or otherwise enable you to access third party products or services. Please note that, while using such products or services, you are using products or services developed and administered by people or companies not affiliated with or controlled by Sportist. Sportist is not responsible for the actions of those people or companies, the content of their products or services, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer. The fact that Sportist is linking to those products or services does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those people or companies.

Please note that certain Apps that Sportist may offer, such as multiplayer gaming, social networking and gaming console services, may use third party services to provide authentication for the Apps with a gaming console ID, social networking ID or gaming network account. When you register to join or use the Apps from a third-party gaming or social networking system, certain personally identifiable user and/or membership data may be transferred automatically to and from Sportist and you hereby consent to the processing, using, combining, disclosing and retaining of such data in accordance with this Privacy Policy by Sportist.

Safeguards
Sportist follows generally accepted industry standards and maintains reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information in Sportist’s possession. Only those persons with a need to process your personal data in connection with the fulfillment of their tasks in accordance with the purposes of this Privacy Policy and for the purposes of performing technical maintenance, have access to your personal data in Sportist’s possession. Personal data collected by Sportist is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. To prevent unauthorized on-line access to personal data, Sportist maintains personal data behind a firewall-protected server. However, no system can be 100% secure and there is the possibility that despite Sportist’s reasonable efforts, there could be unauthorized access to your personal data. By using the Apps, you assume this risk, and Sportist will not be liable for any misappropriation or theft of your personal data.

Other
Please be aware of the open nature of certain social networking and other open features of the Apps Sportist may make available to you. You may choose to disclose data about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to the Apps. Any data that you disclose in any of these forums, blogs, chats or the like is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality. Sportist is not responsible for any personal data you choose to make public in any of these forums.

If you are under 15 years of age or a minor in your country of residence, please ask your legal guardian’s permission to use or access the Apps. Sportist takes children’s privacy seriously, and encourages parents and/or guardians to play an active role in their children’s online experience at all times. Sportist does not knowingly collect any personal information from children below the aforementioned age and if Sportist learns that Sportist has inadvertently gathered personal data from children under the aforementioned age, Sportist will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such personal data from Sportist’s records.

Sportist may store and/or transfer your personal data to our affiliates and partners in and outside of EU/EEA member states and the United States in accordance with applicable law and this Privacy Policy. Sportist may disclose your personal data to third parties in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of Sportist’s stock and/or assets or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process provided, however, that this Privacy Policy shall continue to govern such personal data.
